From a young age, numbers fascinated me‚ÄîI even corrected my father‚Äôs calculations at just three years old. My discoveries span number theory, algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and physics. One of my greatest achievements, the Gaussian distribution (bell curve), revolutionized probability and statistics. My work in modular arithmetic laid the groundwork for cryptography, and my contributions to non-Euclidean geometry influenced Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity. Even in astronomy, my mathematical insights helped predict the orbit of celestial bodies with precision.
